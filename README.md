# archunit
Demo for archunit validation with plant UML 

### ArchUnit's Focus:

ArchUnit is a static analysis tool that works with the structure of your code (e.g., classes, packages, dependencies).

It cannot analyze dynamic behavior or runtime interactions, which are described in sequence diagrams.

### Sequence Diagrams:

Sequence diagrams describe how objects interact with each other over time (e.g., method calls, messages).

These interactions are not part of the static code structure and cannot be validated by ArchUnit.
